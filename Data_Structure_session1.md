Time Complexity : It is the measurement for no. of operations propertional of input size.


Recursion: One which recurs , repeat itself 





We will need to have (5) more planes to support (1) plane to give a full round of earth. we can solve this puzzle like this - lets think that from the island to the same island by rounding the Earth is the route 'R'. The fuel tank of the planes is 'F'. So we need to have 2F tank fuel to complete route R.  We will start call the Island as 'I' and after the first completed 50% of R we will start  call it 'I-dash' as now the airport is at front , not at the back .  And we will start our journey pointing East side. Now in the very beginning we can launch 3 planes 'A' , 'B' & 'C' . They all go the 25% of R means R/4 . They all have used 50% of the fuel means (F/2 ) as (R=2F). Now B & C individually give their 25% of F(F/4) and they have 25% of F(F/4) as remaining Fuel. at 25% of route(R/4) A had 50% of Fuel as remaining(F/2) now with 25% of F from both planes individually A is now again with Full tank(A[F/2] +B[F/4]+C[F/4] = A[F]). Now lets think about bringing back B & C safely as they fave only 25% of F(F/4). So with this F/4 fuel they can only fly 12.5% of R(R/8) as (R=2F) so they fly back to west to get to  closer to the airport. Now lets fly another plane 'D' with F fuel. It goes to 12.5% of R (R/8)  and meet with B & C as they were coming back . Now as they all uses 25% of Fuel(F/4) to go R/8 and D has 75% of Fuel(F-F/4 = 3F/4 or 3*(F/4)) as remaining, we can divide the remaining fuel of D into equal 3 25% of F. And with this B,C,D comes back to the Island as they only had to complete R/8 with F/4. Now , lets roll bak to A, A is now at  first 25% of R with 100% of Fuel (F), With this fuel it  can fly another 50% of R, So now it will be at 75% of R (3R/4). Now the Island is in R/4 distance forward. another 25%(R/4) is remaining. Now we fly another plane 'E' pointing west side. The plane Goes R/4 with F/2 of fuel. Now it still has F/2 as remaining fuel. It gives half of it to A. Now both A & E has 25% of F(F/4) individually. With this F/4 they goes 12.5% of R(R/8) forward . And now we can send another plane 'G' to bring back both A & E with G just how we did it to B & C with D.
